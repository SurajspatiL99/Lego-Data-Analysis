# Lego-Data-Analysis
The dataset is from https://rebrickable.com/downloads/.

From the Rebrickable website - "The LEGO Parts/Sets/Colors and Inventories of every official LEGO set in the Rebrickable database is available for download as csv files here. These files are automatically updated daily. If you need more details, you can use the API which provides real-time data, but has rate limits that prevent bulk downloading of data."

Rebrickable provides this database to be used for any purpose.

## LEGO Data Model

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/). It contains detailed information about thousands of Lego sets, including their set numbers, names, prices, piece counts, themes, and more. The dataset is provided in CSV format.

## Prerequisites

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, the following prerequisites should be installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE of your choice

The following Python libraries are required as well:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

These libraries can be installed using pip with the following command:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download and extract the ZIP file.

```
git clone https://github.com/SurajspatiL99/Lego-Data-Analysis.git
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python IDE.

```
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open the `LEGO Data Analysis.ipynb` file.

4. Execute the code cells in sequential order to run the analysis step by step.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis covers the following aspects:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain an understanding of the dataset by visualizing and summarizing its contents.

- Price Analysis: Analyze the price distribution of Lego sets and explore the relationship between prices and other variables.

- Theme Analysis: Investigate the distribution of Lego sets across different themes and identify the most common themes.

- Piece Count Analysis: Examine the distribution of piece counts in Lego sets and analyze the relationship between piece counts and prices.

- Correlation Analysis: Identify correlations between different variables, such as piece count, price, and year of release.

- Visualization: Create various plots and visualizations to present the findings of the analysis.
