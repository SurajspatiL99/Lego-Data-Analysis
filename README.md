The dataset is from https://rebrickable.com/downloads/.

From the Rebrickable website - "The LEGO Parts/Sets/Colors and Inventories of every official LEGO set in the Rebrickable database is available for download as csv files here. These files are automatically updated daily. If you need more details, you can use the API which provides real-time data, but has rate limits that prevent bulk downloading of data."

Rebrickable provides this database to be used for any purpose.
